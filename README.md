For my final project, I utilized a data integration tool that follows the widely adopted Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) architecture. Using this approach, I employed various transformations such as Joiner, Expression, Aggregation, and Router to extract data from the OLTP source database of a retail store.

After applying these transformations, I aggregated the extracted data and finally loaded it into the Data Warehouse (DWH). This allows for further analysis and processing of the data, which can provide valuable insights for the business.
